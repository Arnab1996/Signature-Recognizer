# Signature Recognition

Verify authenticity of handwritten signatures through digital image processing and neural networks.

## Usage
- `python sigrecog.py` to run with our implementation of a backpropagation neural network.
- `python sigrecogtf.py` to run with a tensorflow model created using logistic regression.

## Built with
- OpenCV
- Tensorflow

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- `pip install opencv-python`
- OpenCV 3.2
- Numpy
- `python -m pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- Tensorflow

## Dataset
The dataset used was gotten from the ICDAR 2009 Signature Verification Competition (SigComp2009).
